# JOGLFramework

JOGLFramework aims to simplify OpenGL-relating processing by wrapping raw functions provided by Java OpenGL (JOGL).

It also provides several wrapper functions for Java OpenAL (JOAL).

This project is currently under development. Therefore the specification is subject to frequent change.
